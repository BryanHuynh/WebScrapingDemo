# WebScrapping for Hackathon 2021

Hi! 
This repository is for the CSUS calgary hacks 2021 workshop where I will be teaching how to use webscraping using the beautiful soup library in python. This includes a jupyter notebook with a step by step guide on how the code works.
The demo revolves around programming a script that will take the name, cost and availabilty of RTX 3070 graphics cards from memory express
# libraries required
using pip you'll need to install
 - Beautiful soup 4
 - lxml
 - requests
`pip install bs4 lxml requests`

If pip is not properly install on your computer you'll need to find the pip module inside your python installation file and add it to your system path. Alternatively you can use the get-pip.py file to get the pip module.

# Opening this package for jupyter notebook
this project includes a jupter notebook with a walkthrough for the code. In order to open this you'll need to install the python library. `pip install notebook`and use `jupyter notebook` to start a server that can be accessed using the provided url.
To access the code just open the `Web scapping tutorial Bs4.ipynb` file from the server inside the browser.
